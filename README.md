# [SQL][Tableau] COVID-19 Data Visualization in 2021

## Introduction
In this project, we will extract and visualize the latest trend of COVID-19 in terms of infection cases, deaths and vaccination data over 230 countries. Analyzing such data could find the answers to the following questions like:
- What are the highest infection count and percentage of the population infected as of August 2021?
- What are the total infection cases and vaccinations by continent in 2021?
- What is the relationship between the total vaccinations and hospitalizations in 2021?
